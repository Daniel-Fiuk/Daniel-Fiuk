## Hello! Nice to meet you! I'm Dan.

I am a graduate of Ontario Tech University and a game systems programmer. I specialize in C# and C++, creating game systems and designer tools for developers and artists in Unity and Unreal Engine.

I'm currently working on a game called Daybreak. A top-down survivor-like focused on short 5-minute gameplay sessions with bullet heaven mechanics.
