<h1 align="center"> Hello! Nice to meet you! I'm Dan. </h1>

I am a game systems programmer and a graduate of Ontario Tech University. I specialize in C# and C++, creating game systems and designer tools for developers and artists in Unity and Unreal Engine. 

Currently, I'm working on a game called Daybreak. A top-down survivor-like focused on short 5-minute gameplay sessions with bullet heaven mechanics. Check it out [here](https://constantine-pallas.itch.io/daybreak) once we release it! While you wait, take a peek at some of our other games like [Moonset](https://www.gamecon.ca/2023/second/stellar-octopians) and [Starlight](https://www.gamecon.ca/2024/third/stellar-octopians)!
